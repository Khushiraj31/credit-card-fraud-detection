## Methodology

This project uses supervised learning to detect credit card fraud. Data was preprocessed to handle imbalanced classes, and new features were engineered. Three models were trained and evaluated: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The best performing model was selected based on F1-score and precision.
